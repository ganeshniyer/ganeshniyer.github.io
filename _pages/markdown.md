## STeAdS

With the aim of using Software Engineering and technological advancements for the benefit of various aspects of the society, Dr Ganesh founded STeAdS virtual research group in 2021. Students and collaborators from different parts of the world are working with him on various projects. Three focus areas are Cultural Heritage, Healthcare and Education

### Technology for Arts and Cultural Heritage

Traditional theatre arts such as Kathakali from India and Wayang Kulit from Indoensia are originated centuries ago and are in the current scope for research by STeAds on applying technologies such as artificial intelligence, image processing and cloud computing. 

### Healthcare

The reseacch scope is currently (not limited to) on exploring TinyML and similar technologies for AI at the edge of the network, AI for helping kids wth learning disability etc. 

### Education

Primary scope is looking at building platforms for students to get industry like experience in Software Engineering development principles and practices. Examples include budiling an academic project management platform, a platform for custom AI education etc. 

## Research Grant

### HSS Seed Fund (Collaborative Research) 2, 2022 (Co-PI)
